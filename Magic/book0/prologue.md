What happens after death?

No one knows...

But in a place outside space-time, at this place, everything was dark, but even in this dark you can see a queue so longer than the distance between the Earth and Sunn, with so many people that can hurt the eyes and make antisocial people die with a glance, and at the end of it, or would it be the start, it's impossible to know, there was a big platform with a pure white portal and a simple chair with a display above.

Those pleople at the queue are everyone that has died in the entire multiverse, and they are waiting for their time to reincarnate, and in the chair their talents are decided, well, some of their talents.

To determine the talents of a person many things are used, but everyone received a chance to have a 99.99999% aleatory talent draw, actually it's two chances, but one is a positive talent and the another is a negative talent, for example: you receive 10 times basic sword talent and 100 times less magic talent, the number used to determine the multiplicative factor is an ordinary talent, but even with those talents you can be reincarnated in a universe/world where there isn't magic nor swords, so this talent can be pretty useless.

The chance to get something good is really low.

Also because of the uniqueness of this place, no one can perceive time so even if they pass millions of years waiting in this queue, for them it's like only a few seconds has passed, they recover their sense of time when they're at the 10th position, so they can see this 'show', but most of their fellings are sealed, so they don't make a case because, well, because they died.

At this time someone was having his talents raffled:

Name: Geoger Brawn, Race: Human
1° Talent: 2x talent for cooking
2° Talent: -800x talent with saber

After seeing his talents, he got up and walked in the direction of the portal, after that there was an explosion of light and he dissapeared.

While all of this was happening, in a far away place, a man named Evren Sihir was having a hard time.   


Evren has just completed his thirtieth birthday, everything was fine, he got a girlfriend, money, job, a house, and his life was rising.

But for some reason he tought it would be a nice idea to cross a busy road, and then, boom, teh famous truck-kun hit him, he couldn't even resist, died on the spot.
