Beasts have the same cultivation system, but they have a very long lifespan based on their blood line grade, and because they need to train qi, soul and body to advance the ranks, so at the same stage the beasts reign supreme, but the price to pay is their low intelligence, only at the Void Breaking rank they have the same level of a human, in the King rank they can speak and at the Emperor rank they can change into human like form.

The bloodline ranks are:

Soldier    - 1° grade - base lifespan ~100 years
Elite      - 2° grade - base lifespan ~500 years
Captain    - 3° grade - base lifespan ~1000 years
General    - 4° grade - base lifespan ~5000 years

QI, Daos & Laws

The most basic type of 'energy' is the qi, the ranks are:

Common - 1° grade
Rare - 2° grade
Special - 3° grade

Every QI has a quality, low, mid and high.

Also the Common rank is a bit different, for example in the Mortal Plane the Common qi is the Mortal Qi, but in the Immortal Plane the Common Qi is the Immortal Qi, the conversion rate for quality is: 1 mid = 1000 low, 1 high = 100000 mid

An evolution of the Qi is the Dao, but the Dao don't make the Qi useless because you need Qi to use the Dao, the ranks are:

Lesser - 1° grade
Grand - 2° grade
Supreme - 3° grade
Primordial - 4° grade

??? - 5° grade

There aren't any difference between 'quality' only of comprehension, but the 'conversion' rate of power of the same comprehension is around: 1 Grand = 100 Lesser, 1 Supreme = 10000 Grand, 1 Primordial = 1000000 Supreme, 1 ??? = ??? Primordial

And the Law is a merge of multiple Daos the ranks are:

Minor - 1° grade
Superior - 2° grade
Ultimate - 3° grade

??? - 4° grade

The Laws don't have 'quality', nor 'comprehension', only fusion percentage, also there isn't a conversion rate of power, a Minor law can't even think of affection a Superior law, because laws are absolutes.

The percentages are:

< 10% - Grasping of the law
25% - Starting in the law
50% - Proficient in the law
75% - Senior of the law
100% - Master of the law

When you achieve mastery of a law you receive a one time ability to block one attack from a law one grade above
When you achieve mastery of a law you receive a one time ability to kill everyone in your sight that don't have a law of same grade or higher

Because of those abilities any Master of a law is feared in battle, because even if you can kill then, they can still bring together an entire battalion of trillions of beings

As you get a higher fusion percentage new abilities are unlocked
