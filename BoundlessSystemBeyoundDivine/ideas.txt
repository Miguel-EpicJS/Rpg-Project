Divine ranks:

Divine Core: when all your dantian Qi form a Divine Qi Core(Transition stage)

Divine Qi is a Mortal mid grade Qi, this Qi is 10 times more powerful than his low version.

Divine Body: all cells of your body has a small amount of Divine Qi, the better your previous body cultivation the more Divine Qi your cells can hould, but if your body cultivation can't reach Saint rank, when you start the 'Divine refining' you can't efficiently cultivate your body anymore.

Divine Soul: same of the Divine Body, but for the soul.

Divine Element: Now that you have a strong body, soul and core you can convert your dantian Divine Qi into an elemental type of Qi, but except if you have reach the peak of Body and Soul, you can't convert then into an elemental form, when you start to convert your Divine Qi into Divine Elemental Qi you can't back up, or you need to discart your foundation, so you can only back up if you only convert 0.001% of your Divine Qi, more than this and you can become crippled, so if you convert your Qi into fire type all your attacks can have fire element, but you can't use a water attack for example, but if you can convert your Qi into Yang type, you can use all Yang elements, if you convert your Qi into water type, you can use Ice type with only a little of difficult, so you bassicaly can only use your type or derivants, and if you have a special technique you can convert to 2 or more elements, in the God realm there's a technique called 5 transformation elements, with it you can convert your Qi to the five elements, but the difficult is extremelly high and exponnential.

Divine King: Now that you become complete Divine you can start to fill your core with liquid. (Tribulation lightning)

Divine Monarch: With your core filled to the top you need to convert it into a new core, and repeat it until you don't have any more space into your Divine Core.

---

Tribulation lightning is a help from heaven, and only occurs if you don't have a perfect foundation(body, qi and soul at the same realm), because it helps strength your body, soul and qi purity so that you can reach a higher rank, if you have a perfect foundation tribulation lightning only occurs when ascending, because that world don't want to lose a powerhouse, so if it can't have you, its better for you to just die.

Immortal Ranks

In the Immortal Rank you become Immortal, its a blessing and a curse, because no matter what you do, you can't day, even if your body is separatted into quadrillions of particles and separated through countless universes and even realms of the mortal realm, even if your soul is destroyed into nothin, you would always return after some millions, billions, trillios or even quintillions os mileniuns, because you created an Immortal Seed, something that defy the heavens, this seed is indestructible as even someone who is at the Immortal Rank for countless years can't destroy the Immortal Seed of even the weakest Immortal, the only way to "kill" an Immortal is to seal his seed, but this don't kill him nor close his consciouness, and after the seal breaks he can return to his full power, the Immortal Rank also don't have a limit, your power is how much growth your Immortal Seed has.

An Immortal Seed is the conjuncion of every single thing that you learned throught your life, with it you can become Immortal and talent means nothing, you can evolve everything that you learned, but you can't learn new things, if you never ever reach close to fire daos in your mortal life, you would never be able to learn then as an Immortal
