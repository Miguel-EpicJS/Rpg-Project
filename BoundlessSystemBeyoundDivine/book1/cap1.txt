Title: Prologue

Year 3579 of the Vaston Empire, 10000 Cosmic Cycle

It was night and at this moment in the Heavenly Phoenix Sect outer's sect disciples dormitory, in a certain dormitory a disciple was having some sort of bad dream, because he was sweating and rolling around his bed, sometimes even growning a little, thankfully he was one of the top outer sect disciple, or else his roomates would be very unhappy.

Every outer disciple above rank 100 can have a personal dormitory, but only inner disciples could have a personal house, and core disciples could even have servants to do they needs.

But at this moment, the young boy with a bad dream wake up.

"Uhhh, what happen?"

"Did I have a nightmare?"

"Well I should just return to sleep, what a weird dream, I tought it was real, but how is possible that I can transmigrate into a world o cultivatio?"

"Its obviously because of the webnovels that I'm reading, but that dream wasn't so bad, only the final was bad, when that b*stard tried to cut off my head, I think his name is John?"

"Wait, when did people in dreams have names, or even colors, smells, touches, taste and..., even pain?"

At this moment a click happened in his mind.

The young boy pinched himself.

"So I really transmigratted, that's awesome!", he said out aloud.

"Whoops, I should't have said this aloud, what if someone heard me?, I need to be more careful, but a thing that's good is that my name is the same from Earth, 'Evren'!"

"Well, I'm still tired, so for now I'm gonna return to sleep and think more about my situation tomorrow"

With this tought, Evren return to his sleep, but just after he sleeps, something incredible happen and if he was awake, he would't have the mind to return to sleep.

[ Do you want to use the Standart System Grade or The Mortal System Grade? ]

[1... 2... 3...]

[ No Answer, system shutdowing... ]

--------

At the same time, in a far, far away place, so far that even Immortal level powerhouses would take millions of years to go there, a person, so strong that can destroy worlds and immortals with a mere blink, suddlendly moved, a thing that this being didn't do for eras, he opened his eyes and while looking trought the void, he said:

"So you finnaly moved?"

"I hope that this can lift my curse, or at least bring me some fun for some billions of years until if fades into forgoteness like millions others until destruction and eternal suffering falls over everyone... including me..."

After murmuring those terrifing things, this being again close his eyes, destroying some nearby planets and become like an ancient sculpure.

--------

Finnaly morning comes, even if it's a little early, at most 4 am, all cultivators are getting up, because the path to Immortality is endless and everyone needs to use the optimun of their time, and this is the same for Evren, but he wake up early because of another reason, and his first's toughts were:

"Wow, I sleep really fast, I think that's because of the competition that happened yesterday, but first let's recall everything correctly"

...

"Hmm, so currently I'm 17 years old, top 94 in the outer sect ranking and have a high grade Earth talent, which in the Mortal Kingdom is a perless genius but in a sect like the Heavenly Phoenix this is only above average, where the average is low grade Earth talent, bellow that you can only enter throught the back door, and Heaven grade talent can go direct to the inner sect, there was a battle yesterday, and it was the anual outer sect championship, altough killing isn't allowed that b*stard John is vicious and a battle junkie, he always tries to kill his oponents, and even succed one time, but he got away with a light punishment because his father is an outer sect elder and his grandfather is an inner sect elder, so even if he can't directly kill people, in a championship its possible for him, also his position in the outer rank is the top 69째, but his real strength is around top 30째, for some reason he like the number 69째, and said that aside from this number, the only other number worthy him is the top 1째"

"Also the championship is optional, but if you don't participate, you automaticly drop to the last rank, which's around 10000, and the top 1 can directly go to the inner sect, while the top 10 can do a write test and if they pass they can also go to the inner sect, the write test exist because the sect don't want a bunch of battle junkies, you don't need to be an scholar, but need to at least recognize common and heavenly herbs and metals, what beast has which element and some other things such as basic math, this is a rule that the founder put, because its said that his talent wasn't much good(that's probably nonsense or else he wouldn't be able to create a sect such as the Heavenly Phoenix sect, and everyone in the sect would be a top powerhouse), but because of his intelligence he could fight agains levels and even got oportunities that no one sees".

"With my talent I can become at least an outer sect's elder or an inner sect disciple, but I don't want this, I'm a transmigrator, even if my talent is average I think I can hope for more, or at least die trying!, anyway I already died once, twice wouldn't make much difference."

"I need to reach the peak and become an Immortal!"

"So for now my little quest is to become a Void Breaking expert, which is the most powerful realm that I know, its said that an expert at this level can break the Void and teleport throught space!!!"

"So for now my rotine is gonna be to train until I colapse every day, the Body Forging rank is the easiest to pass, because in the Qi Gathering rank you need to gather Qi into your dantian, but Qi is too powerful to the mortal body, so even though you can store large amounts, you can't use much, or else you simple explode, so in the Body Forging you need to Train your body to be able to handle the QI"

"The realms are divided into early, middle, top and peak, a peak Body Forging can win against a peak Qi Gathering with just his body, but can't kill him without his Qi, because the Qi Gathering can throw caution to the wind and use all his Qi to make an all out attack, and because the amount of Qi they have is bassically the same, the Body Forging can easely die if they don't have their guard up".

When Evren finished organising his toughtsm it was already 4 and a half in the morning, and right at time, the system shows up again, it looked like the system was only waiting for him to set up his plan.

Evren then heard a sound that come from his ear, no, it comes from his mind, and in the future he's gonna discover that this very simple sound come from something more profound than the soul...

[DING]

And then a blue screen with a loading bar appeared

[System Booting... 1%... 10%... 50%... 70%... 90%... ERROR]

[ Do You Want To Use The Standart System Grade or The Mortal System Grade? ]

"WTF???"

"Is this my cheat???"

"I though that I would't get anything, perhaps I don't receive it when I transmigrated because my soul was disturbed?"

"Well this don't matter, the important is that with a golden finger my path to the peak is gonna be smoother, this is awesome!"

"Wait, but why does it ocurred an error when loading?"

[DING]

[Answering the host, an error ocurred because you don't completed the necessary conditions]

"Necessary conditions?" 

"Since when a cheat/golden finger needs conditions to be unlocked!"

"I never read about this!"

After Evren calmed a little he asked in his mind, because Evren already perceived that the system can read his mind and thoughts.

"And what are the necessary conditions?".

[DING]

[ Answering the host, just look to the UI ]

Evren then looked to one of the multiple screens in front of him.

[Conditions to awake the Boundless system]

[1. Become a cultivator at the QI Gathering rank - COMPLETED]
[2. Transmigrate to another world - COMPLETED]
[3. Learn a technique at the IMMORTAL RANK - INCOMPLETED]

When Evren read the conditions he started to cursing in his mind.

"F*ck DO I NEED TO LEARN AN IMMORTAL TECHNIQUE TO HAVE THE SYSTEM, I DON'T EVEN HAVE AN EARTH GRADE TECHNIQUE!?"

"If I have an immortal technique would I even need a system???, I could just train it and become an Immortal!"

"What nonsense is this?"

"Is this a prank?"

[ Answering the host, no this isn't a prank, and you can have the system without learning an Immortal Rank Techinique, its just that the core functions are only avaible when you learn an Immortal Rank Technique ]

"Hmmm, I hope that those function are usefull, well then what can I do?"

[ Answering the host, you can see your stats ]

"That's it?"

[ Answering the host, yes, that's it ]

"Wtf, so this system is pretty useless."

"Well, let's at least see my status"

[DING]

"Wait, what is this with Trash talent? "

"My talent isn't trash, even thought its average, it isn't trash!"

"But, wow, bloodlines, that is very good, I like this Heavenly Will bloodline, the Ancient Human bloodline perhaps come from my ancestors and this Wood Wyver?, I don't have idea."

"Wyvern are descendents of true dragons, and even wyvers when reach adulthood can be more powerful than a Void Breaking powerhouse, but why the grades are good for Heavenly Will and Ancient Human, and trash for the Wood Wyvern, that's completly wrong!"

[ Answering the host, do You Want To Use The Standart System Grade or The Mortal System Grade?]

"So the system has his grade measuring system? Well that's new."

"What are the system grades?"

[ Answering the host, the grades are: trash, good and perfect ]

"Well, I don't know what those means, but if even a Wood Wyvern that would have a talent above Heaven grade can only be considered trash, this system looks powerful, but I can't even use his full options!"

"So, for now let's use the Mortal Grade System"

[ Loading... 1%... 10%... 50%... 100% ]

[ 

Name: Evren Danafour   

Cultivation: Early Body Forging

Constitution: [ EXPAND ]
 
Bloodlines: Heavenly Will(0.000002%, !#*$@ grade), Ancient Human(0.0003%, !$@(* grade), Wood Wyvern (0.001%, High Royal grade), Danafour Blood (99.998698%, Low Mortal grade)

Talent: High Earth grade(sealed !$##%**&)

Special Traits: None

]

"Hmm, that's better, Royal grade is probably above Heaven grade, but what are those strange symbols?"

[ Answering the host, those strange symbols are grades that aren't allowed in the Mortal Realm, so there isn't a name for them in the Mortal Grade System ]

"Wow, does this mean that I have a sealed talent that is above the Mortal Realm??!!"

"Awesome!!!"

[ Answering the host, yes, but even this talent is still trash grade, if you can unlock the core functions of the system you can upgrade your talent. ]

"Tsc, don't kill my happiness, well let's see what my consitution is."

[
Constitution: 

Eyes: Normal(dorment True Yang eyes mortal variant, high Heaven grade )
Active Bloodline: Danafour Blood
Bone: Normal
Physique: Normal(dorment Continental Giant, high Earth grade)
]


"Incredible, I have an special eye and psyque!"

"Altough they're all dormants and I don't have any ideia to awake then, perhaps the psyque needs something related to blood or earth, and the eyes need some yang treasure, I don't know."

"System how can I awake my psyques?"

[ Answering the host, the system don't have the answer, you need to have access to the core functions for learn this ]

"That don't help much, so for now I'm gonna make a routine to become an Immortal!"

"First: wake up at 4 am"
"Second: train my skills/body for 3 hours"
"Third: half hour pause for breakfast"
"Fourth: train my skills/body for 3 hours"
"Fifth: half hour pause for lunch"
"Sixth: make sect missions, especially to hunt beasts, until 6 pm"
"Seventh: have dinner and half hour rest"
"Eight: study herbs, beast, metals, etc, for four hours"
"Repeat until reach peak Body Forging"

"Ugh, well this is gonna be hard. but I can't relly on the system and needs to become an Immortal, so let's start now!"

And from today a legend is born, he still didn't perceive this, but his personallity was slowling change, why would he want to become an Immortal, why would he train so hard and could even die?

Even thought in his first life he was intelligent and in his second life he is more courageos, this don't justify, is this the system?

Or something greater?
